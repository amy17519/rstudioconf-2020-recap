# RMarkdown

- Now you can use Rmarkdown to produce (almost) any type of documents. You can even reuse them easily

--
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(rmarkdown) # Docs
library(xaringan)  # Slides
library(blogdown)  # Blogs or simple website
library(pkgdown)   # R package website
library(bookdown)  # Write a book
```

[1] Rob Hyndman had a talk on Rmd. He uses Rmarkdown for everything except writing emails. Has template R packages etc.

[2] Yihui had a cool demo on how changing 1-5 lines can change one single Rmd into 14 different format

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(usethis)   # Set up stuff that you can't ever remember
library(roxygen2)  # Documentation

# ggplot2

- The general trend: encourage people to build their own extensions instead of contributing back to ggplot2. 

- Upcoming release of 4.0

- Focus on faster rendering of plots

--

- ggproto: basically build your own gg class

# library(later)

- Asynchronous programming came up a lot. Partly due to popularity of shiny.

- Schedule an R function or formula to run after a specified period of time.

- Similar to JavaScript's setTimeout function. 

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
later::later(function() {
  summary(mtcars)
}, 5)
```
